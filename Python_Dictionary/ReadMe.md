### Problem Definition

Consider following type of data set.
```
a 1
a 2
a 3
a 4
b 5
b 6 
b 7
c 8
c 9
```

And we want an ouput like this
```
a 1, 2, 3, 4
b 5, 6, 7
c 8, 9
```

i.e. each unique value in column 1 is associated with values in common 2 if the value in column 1 is same

The input file is something like [this](https://github.com/lakhujanivijay/GeneralProblems/blob/master/Python_Dictionary/out2.txt); and the output file is [this](https://github.com/lakhujanivijay/GeneralProblems/blob/master/Python_Dictionary/out2.txt)
